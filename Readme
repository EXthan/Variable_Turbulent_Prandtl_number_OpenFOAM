These files were used to calculate variable turbulent Prandtl number at each time step. The model was applied to smagorinsky referring following paper:
Lilly, D. K. (1992). A proposed modification of the Germano subgrid‚Äêscale closure method. Physics of Fluids A: Fluid Dynamics, 4(3), 633-635.

I have done this a few years ago so I do not remeber everything within it. I will try to fix some warnings but not sure when. If someone works on it and improves it, Please let me know.
